Impossible!ðŸ˜±
Im already learning Node.js. Hope i will make it!


To run some of the scripts and see the changes(in db.json), type in console such commands:
npm run generate = generate 5 random contacts,     
npm run add-one = add one new contact,     
npm run get-all = get all the contacts in console,     
npm run count = get a whole count of all contacts that are now available(you will just receive one number in console),     
npm run remove-all = remove all the contacts,     
npm run remove-last = remove last contact in the list,
